# Modular Navigation System in Android with Jetpack Navigation

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a **modular navigation system** using **Jetpack Navigation** in Android. The system follows a **feature-based modular architecture**, enabling scalable and maintainable navigation across different modules and screens.

For a detailed explanation of the architecture and implementation, refer to the Medium article:

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules to ensure **separation of concerns** and **modularity**:

- **`app`**: Contains the main activity and hosts the navigation system.
- **`core:navigation`**: Defines shared navigation routes and public destinations accessible by multiple modules.
- **`feature:feature1`**: Implements screens and navigation routes specific to Feature1.
- **`feature:feature2`**: Implements screens and navigation routes specific to Feature2.

## Key Features

- âœ… **Jetpack Navigation** for efficient navigation management.
- âœ… **Modular architecture** to enhance scalability and maintainability.
- âœ… **Encapsulation of routes** to separate public and private destinations within each module.
- âœ… **Independent navigation definitions** within feature modules.
